# tfvars vs variables.tf
# What is a .tfvars file? This is a confusing topic as terraform.tfvars and variables.tf serve a similar role, as in both are variable files.
# However, a tfvars file stores the default values from a variables.tf file and allows you to override values if required.

# *.tfvars are NOT committed in git when terraform is triggered manually from a laptop (containing sensitive data/credentials)
# Since this is triggered by Azure DevOps, we want to include *.tfvars to separate environments. Credentials are not saved here but in Azure KeyVault.
